🔥 Firemate – IoT Based Fire Detection & Alert System
📌 Overview

The average response time for firefighters in some areas of Tamil Nadu can exceed the national standard of 15 minutes, mainly due to delays in receiving fire incident information. Such delays often result in major loss of life and property.
To address this issue, Firemate is developed as an IoT-based fire detection and alert system that helps firefighters receive real-time fire information quickly and accurately.

🎯 Objective

Reduce firefighter response time

Provide real-time fire alerts

Share accurate location details of fire incidents

Minimize loss of life and property
